# Organizational_App by AugustTimes77

This is a small organizational app I am building as a side project, the main reason
I am building this is to learn the .NET framework to become more familiar with it
and prepare myself for later situations where I will build more complex applications.
This is also a prototype for another app I want to work on when this is finished except
I will build it through .NET MAUI to be able to add to my Iphone.
